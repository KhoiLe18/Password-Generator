# Password-Generator
My first personal project where I aim to create a program that generates a random password based on the user's requirements

How to try it out:
 1. Simply download the .exe file, then run it.
 2. OR you can download the .cpp and .h files and compile it yourself.

Version 2.0: 
 - Got rid of the inAndOut module. 
 - The program runs now but there is still a posibility that the password does not meet the requirements. 
 - Temporary solution: run it again.

Version 1.0: 
 - Currently having linker issue.
 - Program does not run
